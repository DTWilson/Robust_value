The price of power: Robust, value-based sample size determination for clinical trials when nuisance parameters are unknown

Background:

Conclusion:


Motivating problem is uncertainty in nuisance parameters, particularly those which are hard to get interim estimates of.

SSD / SSR with the conventional contrained formulation hgighly sentive to the estimates, so large variability in the
final n (and when estimates are poor, large variability in the final power too). Can lead to cases where a very large
sample is requested at the interim. Need to decide how large a sample is tollerated, but no guidance on how to do so.
Lack of consistency, in the sense that we can "pay" vastly different costs (sample sizes) to obtain the same value (power).

We suggest an alternative fomulation of the SSD / SSR problem, based on maximising value rather than minimising cost s.t. constrained power,
where value is a weighted sum of sample size and power.

We argue that this is a better model of SSD, both in a normative and descriptive sense (including the "sample size samba" of MCID adjustment), 
compared to the constrained optimisation model.

We show that under this model, in many problems there will be little justification for SSR - the initial fixed design will not be very sub-optimal.

The implication is that trial designs robust to variation in nuisance parameters can be obtained without the practical and logistical 
trouble associated with interim analyses.

We illutsrtae the approach by applying it to two SSD problems: choosing the number of clsueters in a cluster randomised parellel group trial 
with uncertain variance components at both the individual and cluster levels; and choosing the accrual and follow-up
time periods in a parellel group trial with an overall survivial endpoint and uncertain event rate in the control arm.
